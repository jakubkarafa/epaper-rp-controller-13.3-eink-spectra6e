## üíæ Quick Install

1. **Download or clone the app folder** (e.g. `epaper_app/`) to your Raspberry Pi (or any Linux with Python 3.8+)

2. **Install dependencies** (recommended: virtual environment):

   ```bash
   cd epaper-rp-controller-13.3-eink-spectra6e
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set your passwords and keys** in `config.py`:

   ```python
   SECRET_KEY = "change_this"
   API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_admin_password_here"
   USER_PASSWORD = "your_user_password_here"
   ```

   *(Change all values!)*

4. **Palettes already included:**
   - Official `.act` color palettes for this display, downloaded from the [Waveshare wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/13.3inch_e-Paper_HAT%2B_(E)), are already in the `palettes/` folder.
   - You can add more or manage palettes any time via the Admin tab (after admin login).

5. **Run the server:**

   **A. To use standard web port 80 (so you can use [http://eink.local](http://eink.local)):**

   ```bash
   sudo python server.py
   ```

   *Port 80 requires sudo (root) on Linux. This lets you visit the app at [http://eink.local](http://eink.local) or [http://your-pi-ip](http://your-pi-ip).*

   - **Using `http://eink.local`:**  
   To access your Pi at `http://eink.local`, your Raspberry Pi's hostname **must be set to `eink`**.  
   You can set or change your Pi's hostname with `sudo raspi-config` ‚Üí `System Options` ‚Üí `Hostname`.  
   After changing, reboot your Pi.

   > üí° `eink.local` works if your network supports mDNS/Bonjour (default on Windows, Mac, and most Linux).

   **B. If you prefer not to use sudo:**
   Edit the last line of `server.py` to use a port above 1024 (e.g., 5000):

   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)
   ```

   Then start normally:

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   And access it at [http://your-pi-ip:5000](http://your-pi-ip:5000)

6. **Open your browser:**

   - **See your Pi's IP on startup:**  
   The app prints your Raspberry Pi‚Äôs IP address and chosen port when starting, so you always know what address to open in your browser.
   * Visit [http://your-pi-ip:port](http://your-pi-ip:port)
   * Log in with your user password

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tips & FAQ

* **Change or reset passwords:** Edit `config.py` and restart the server
* **Multiple users:** All share one password unless you add usernames (easy to extend)
* **Start at boot:** Use `tmux`, `screen`, or a simple `systemd` unit
* **Security:** Change ALL default credentials and API keys!

## üÜò Troubleshooting

* **Virtualenv errors:** Always use a virtualenv for `pip install`, never `sudo pip install ...`
* **"No palettes found":** Upload a palette in Admin tab
* **Display/hardware issues:** Ensure the Waveshare drivers are installed, and wiring is correct
